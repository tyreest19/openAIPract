Given the XYZ system is a company-wide application that accepts personnel and payroll information from each of the companyâ€™s 50 remote offices across the U.S., processes payroll and produces payroll reports
And the system is networked to each of the remote offices and will link to the Internal Revenue Service by modem to transmit payroll tax deposits and tax reports
When the system integration testing is performed
Then all payroll business processes should be supported
And all timekeeping functions should work correctly
And direct deposit functions should work correctly
And payroll functions should work correctly
And the system should be easy to use by the end-users
And payroll policies and procedures should be supported by the system
And the system can be customized by remote offices to handle localized payroll processing needs
And the system complies with all government payroll tax reporting format requirements
And financial controls are adequate to prevent fraudulent transactions
